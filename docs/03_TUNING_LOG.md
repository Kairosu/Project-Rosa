# 03 · TUNING LOG

## ⚡ CURRENT STATUS (update at every session end)

**As of 2026-07-14, end of Phase 2 session 3:**
- **Phase 0: GATE PASSED. Phase 1: GATE PASSED** (2-client netsim, user-verified).
- **Phase 2 build COMPLETE.** Sprint, wall-crash knockdown, real falls (hips heap
  with the body), assisted get-up with watchdog, BT/TS/AL live knobs + sliders.
- **Session 3 (user feedback pass #2): no more pinned-marionette states.**
  A rise that topples re-releases IMMEDIATELY (was: up to ~1 s downed on a fully
  powered, walkable capsule — the "pinned by the hips" report); balance dips
  floor at the knockdown threshold (was: near-zero balance on a standing capsule
  = "limbs ragdolled, hips pinned, still walkable"); knockdown band widened
  (knockdownFactor 0.3→0.45 — you either wobble readably or you GO DOWN);
  capsule release now enforced every step; walking locked during the get-up;
  turn speed halved (BaseTurnSpeed 16→8) for the ice-skate pivot feel.
- **User playtest items for Gate 2** (feel checks, minutes of play):
  1. **When ANYTHING feels pinned/wrong: press "Capture last 7 s"** in the
     panel (fall recorder — it also auto-captures every knockdown). Then just
     say so; the capture holds the exact client-side frames.
  2. Turn feel — **TurnSpeed slider** (default 8, stock was 16) and
     **AccelLean slider**. Tune live; report the values that feel right.
  3. Knockdowns — walls are binary now (walk-bump nothing, ≥ brisk jog DOWN);
     body + hips heap together. Get-up is still an assisted pivot (Phase 3
     makes it physical); walking locked until ~1.5 s after standing — say if
     that lockout feels too long.
  4. **Hover ladder** (leg-supported locomotion direction): drop the
     **StandForce slider** 10000 → 5000 → 2500 → 0 and walk/stairs at each.
     Standing at 0 already holds (legs carry the body through the Root
     socket); we're mapping where walking breaks.
  5. Sprint feel, stairs up/down, walk-stop feel (unchanged since session 2).
- **Then the Gate 2 netsim run** (2 players, 150 ms + jitter + 2 % loss):
  observing-client readability of all of the above, **numeric recv KB/s**
  (carried from Gate 1 — note it from the panel), and check whether
  `list_roblox_studios` sees test-server/client instances (04_PREFLIGHT §2).
- Read the ☠️ workflow laws in CLAUDE.md § THE ENVIRONMENT before touching
  anything, plus the **MCP live-testing laws** in the Phase 2 session-1 entry
  below (custom IAS instances wedge input sync; one keyboard burst per play
  session; file sync pauses during Play mode).

## WHY THIS FILE EXISTS

This is a **coupled PD-controller system across 15 joints.** The stable region is found
**empirically**, over many iterations, and the values are **precious**.

If a good configuration is discovered and not written down, **it is lost** — and rediscovering
it costs hours. There is no analytical solution. There is only the log.

**Append every value that survives a gate. Never delete a row — supersede it.**

---

## FORMAT

Record what you changed, what it did, and whether it survived. Failures are as valuable as
successes: knowing that `AngularStrength = 1.4` on the neck explodes the sim is worth as
much as knowing that `0.6` works.

---

## JOINT VALUES — CURRENT

> **Official tuning recipe (API reference):** a joint at the **root of the chain**
> (hips/waist) doesn't "see" the effective mass of everything downstream, so it can
> oscillate at low frequency **even critically damped.** Fix: raise **both**
> `AngularStrength` **and** `AngularDamping` above defaults on root-ward joints.
> **Tune root-out: waist → hips → shoulders → distal.**
> Starting stance: `AngularDamping = 1` (critical) everywhere, then adjust.

| Joint | AngularStrength | AngularDamping | MaxTorque | Density | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Root | 1.0 | 1.25 | 3000 | n/a (HRP 2.0 mass) | + RootBallSocket (ours) |
| Waist | 1.0 | 1.25 | 3000 | LowerTorso 1.2 | |
| Neck | 1.0 | 1.0 | 3000 | Head 0.7 | |
| LeftShoulder | 1.0 | 1.0 | 3000 | UpperArm 0.6 | |
| LeftElbow | 1.0 | 1.0 | 3000 | LowerArm 0.4 | |
| LeftWrist | 1.0 | 1.0 | 3000 | Hand 0.3 | |
| RightShoulder | 1.0 | 1.0 | 3000 | UpperArm 0.6 | |
| RightElbow | 1.0 | 1.0 | 3000 | LowerArm 0.4 | |
| RightWrist | 1.0 | 1.0 | 3000 | Hand 0.3 | |
| LeftHip | 1.0 | 1.25 | 3000 | UpperLeg 1.0 | |
| LeftKnee | 1.0 | 1.0 | 3000 | LowerLeg 0.7 | |
| LeftAnkle | 1.0 | 1.0 | 3000 | Foot 0.6 | |
| RightHip | 1.0 | 1.25 | 3000 | UpperLeg 1.0 | |
| RightKnee | 1.0 | 1.0 | 3000 | LowerLeg 0.7 | |
| RightAnkle | 1.0 | 1.0 | 3000 | Foot 0.6 | |

> **2026-07-14 status:** the above (= AJU factory defaults + 1.25 damping root-ward, on
> the listed densities) stands rock-solid: settles ≤1 frame after power-on, steady-state
> max |v| ≈ 1.4–5.7 across all parts including idle sway. UpperTorso density 1.0.
> Torque raises to 50k root-ward were tested and are NOT needed for standing.

## BALANCE & CAPSULE (GroundController)

| Property | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| BalanceMaxTorque | BT attr (default 800) × tone × max(impactFactor, 0.45) (× riseBoost 4 while Rising) | BT is live-tunable (panel slider, remote-validated 0–20000). The 0.45 stagger floor (= knockdownFactor) keeps a standing body from reading as ragdolled (session 3). Ladder: impulse 250 → min up 0.91 @ 800 / 0.82 @ 250 / 0.81 @ 100 (saturates — socket decouples) |
| BalanceSpeed | 100 (stock) | untouched so far |
| BalanceRigidityEnabled | `false` | non-negotiable — CONFIRMED live: rigid balance + powered body = perpetual flail (hard reaction impulses through the Root socket) |
| AccelerationTime | 0.2 | stop/launch whip fix (session 3) |
| DecelerationTime | 0.2 | symmetric smoothing (Phase 2); also keeps normal stops under the wall channel's 400 stud/s² |
| Sprint | Running.SpeedMultiplier = 1.6 → 25.5 stud/s | server-only writer; ability applies it via MoveSpeedFactor |
| BaseTurnSpeed | TS attr (default 8; stock 16) | live-tunable (panel slider, 0–40) — stock 16 is an instant pivot, the "ice skate" turn feel (session 3) |
| AccelerationLean | AL attr (default 1 = stock) | live-tunable (panel slider, 0–4) — lean into accel/decel, feel knob |
| StandForce / BaseMoveSpeed | 10000 / 16; **released per step** while fallTimer > 0 (both → 0); BaseMoveSpeed also 0 while Rising (move lock) | enforcement is per-step write-on-change, not transition-time (session 3) |
| GroundOffset | 2.925 (stock, observed live) | earlier log rows saying 1 were wrong |

**Changed:**
**Result:**
**Verdict:** kept / reverted
**Observing-client check:** pass / fail

---

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 0 — engine baseline facts (not tuning, but load-bearing)

**AJU factory defaults, every one of the 15 R15 joints (read off a live spawn):**

| Property | Default | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `IsKinematic` | `true` | flip to `false` per joint in Phase 1 |
| `AngularStrength` | `1` | |
| `AngularDamping` | `1` | critical |
| `MaxTorque` | `3000` | finite, NOT inf — a plain number |
| `LinearStrength` / `LinearDamping` | `1` / `1` | |
| `MaxForce` | **`0`** | ⚠ linear muscle ceiling is ZERO by default. Translation is held by the paired BallSocketConstraint, not the AnimationConstraint. Phase 1: expect translation to be socket-carried; don't "fix" MaxForce without a measured reason. |

**Rig census on spawn (default R15, AJU active):** 15 `AnimationConstraint`, 0 `Motor6D`,
15 `BallSocketConstraint` (one per joint), 18 `NoCollisionConstraint`.

**Settings state:**
- `AvatarJointUpgrade`: already ACTIVE by default in this Studio build (H2 2026 default-on
  rollout confirmed live) — verified by rig census, since the property itself is
  RobloxScript-protected (unreadable/unwritable from any script context, MCP included).
- `Workspace.AuthorityMode`: RobloxScript-protected too — **must be set to `Server` by hand
  in the Properties panel.** Enum is `{Server, Automatic}`.
- `StarterPlayer.CharacterControlMode = LuaCharacterController` — set via MCP; verified
  live: character spawns with a `ControllerManager`. (Enum:
  `{Default, Legacy, NoCharacterController, LuaCharacterController}`.)
- `StarterPlayer.CharacterBreakJointsOnDeath = false` — set via MCP.

**Verdict:** kept (facts, not choices)
**Observing-client check:** n/a — solo verification; 2-client run is the user's Gate 0 step

---

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 1 — powered joints: the two engine gaps, and the stable region

**The two discoveries that cost the session (both now fixed in `MuscleSystem.setupBody`):**

1. **AJU ships NO BallSocketConstraint on the Root joint** (HRP→LowerTorso; the other 14
   joints each get one). Combined with the factory `MaxForce = 0` on the linear muscle
   channel, powering the rig silently drops the body 2.7 studs out of the capsule
   (Root attachment separation 2.68; all socketed joints hold at ~0.002). **Fix: we add
   `RootBallSocket` ourselves.** Translation is then solver-held like every other joint;
   the linear muscle channel stays at factory zero. (A spring-based Root was tried at
   {2, 1.5, 25000} and {0.75, 2, 8000} — both violently unstable; do not revisit.)

2. **The CCL FloorSensor senses the character's own torso.** Powered bodies get
   world-collidable torso parts (LowerTorso/UpperTorso CanCollide=true), and the
   `ControllerPartSensor` found `SensedPart = UpperTorso` — the hover then chases a
   "floor" that hangs from the hover → feedback loop → the perpetual-breakdance flail
   (~180–260 stud/s, never settles). **Fix: collision groups** — body parts in
   `CharBody`, HRP in `CharRoot`, pair non-collidable, both collide with Default. The
   sensor casts with the root's group, so the body vanishes from its ray
   (SensedPart = actual floor, 10/10 frames). Isolation proof: anchoring the HRP made
   the powered body settle in 4 frames at max |v| 2.06.

**Also confirmed live:** attribute limits are BOTH real — 1024-byte total payload per
instance (46 numeric attrs bust it) AND <50 chars per string value (one packed 300-char
string busts it). Muscle drivers therefore live in 15 per-joint packed triples
("MJ_Waist" = "1,1.25,3000") + MT + Powered = 17 attributes.

**Master tone must SLEW, never step** (1.5/s in MuscleServer): snapping tone onto a
displaced body slingshots it (539 stud/s measured off a 2.7-stud stretch).

**What passed solo (Gate 1 items 1–3 in solo form):**
- Stand: settles ≤1 frame after power-on; steady-state max |v| 1.4–5.7 over repeated
  5 s windows; pose exact (HRP 4.80, Head 6.00, feet planted symmetric); zero guard
  trips; clean console.
- Collapse (remote → MT 0): capsule tips, body heaps face-down, Head Y 0.02,
  settles to max |v| 0.03. Joints read str 0 / torque 0 / still non-kinematic.
- Restore (MT 0→1): gets back up within the ramp window (capsule rights + hover lifts
  + muscles re-pose), no guard trip, returns to clean stand.

**Open for next session — the knockdown sweep:** shoves are proportional (crate at
25/60 stud/s → peak body |v| 31/98, head dips) but he cannot be knocked DOWN: chain
mass is only 1.8 vs HRP 2.0 (R15 blocky part volumes are tiny), so hits fling
feather-limbs without moving the mass. BalanceMaxTorque 10000→2000 changed nothing.
Plan: raise DENSITY ×10–20 (chain toward ~10–20 mass), re-scale MaxTorque per joint to
the new loads, re-sweep BALANCE_TORQUE for the stagger/fall boundary. All three knobs
are in `MuscleSystem.CONFIG`.

**Verdict:** kept (architecture + fixes); knockdown values still open
**Observing-client check:** NOT RUN — solo only. Gate 1 items 5–6 (observing client,
receive rate) plus the full 5-minute soak remain for the 2-client netsim run.

---

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 1 (session 2) — knockdown sweep + the 5-minute soak

**Density ×10 is the knockdown enabler and costs nothing.** Chain mass 1.8 → **18.5**
(vs HRP 2.0) and the stand is *identical* — settles ≤1 frame, steady ≈1.4 stud/s —
because `AngularStrength` is frequency-normalized (gains track mass automatically) and
levers are short (torque 3000 ceilings still never saturate). Final densities are in
`MuscleSystem.CONFIG.DENSITY` (LowerTorso 12 … Hand 3).

**✅ 5-MINUTE STAND SOAK PASSED** (solo, gate item 1): six consecutive 50 s windows,
worst window max |v| = **1.41 stud/s** (= the idle-sway animation), up-vector 1.00
throughout, total drift 0.02 studs. Zero guard trips.

**Impulse ladder (UpperTorso, horizontal), the proportional response (gate item 4):**

| Impulse | peak rel speed | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 100 | ~17 | holds footing (below reflex threshold) |
| 250 | ~28 | staggers to up≈0.87, recovers cleanly |
| 400 | ~108 | **knocked flat** (up→−0.3), stays down |

Staying down at full tone leaves the body "paddling" (muscles chase the standing idle
pose against the ground, ~85 stud/s churn) — that is the **missing Phase 3 DOWN state**,
not a Phase 1 defect. A tone cycle (MT 0 → 1) rescues from ANY state back to a clean
stand — verified from the paddling-flat state.

**The impact reflex** (in `MuscleSystem`, CONFIG.IMPACT = threshold 25 / fallAt 55 /
staggerTime 0.6 / uprightGate 0.7 / rearm 2.0): body-relative speed above threshold
dips balance torque proportionally (zero at fallAt). Three rules learned the hard way:
- threshold must clear recovery-motion noise (18 self-triggered; 25 with the ladder
  above is clean),
- **upright-gated**: a tilted/rising body must never re-dip itself,
- **one dip per window (rearm)**: without a 2 s lockout it re-fires the instant the
  body crosses back over the upright gate and it struggles at the boundary forever.

**BalanceMaxTorque = 800** baked (stand is solid even at 300; raw-physics knockdowns
exist at any value once the chain is heavy — the reflex just makes the fall threshold
designable).

**⚠ WORKFLOW LAW (cost half this session): `execute_luau` runs in a separate Luau VM
from game scripts.** Module/CONFIG mutations from a command are placebo for the live
loop; require() there builds a fresh module instance. Only instances/properties/
attributes cross. All "live sweeps" of module values earlier this session were placebo —
by luck, everything validated ran on the baked file values. Also: per-file sync can lag
several seconds; `script_grep` a changed symbol before starting any play session (one
stale-file session produced 30 minutes of false diagnosis).

**Verdict:** kept — this is the Phase 1 solo configuration
**Observing-client check:** NOT RUN — items 5–6 need the 2-client netsim session

---

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 1 (session 3) — feel pass: ragdoll falls, soft arms, stop-whip

**User feedback driving this session:** falls too rigid; arms too stiff; forward-then-back
lean when stopping a walk.

**Fall reflex (Phase 3 seed, in MuscleServer + CONFIG.FALL):** tilt below up=0.55 →
master tone slews to 0.15 (limp DURING the fall — this is what makes falls ragdoll) →
1.6 s down → `Rising` attribute set → balance ×4 while rising → one committed rise →
re-arm only after 0.5 s continuously upright. Full cycle measured: hit → limp fall →
heap → single clean rise → stable stand in ~3.5 s, zero guard trips.
Two failure modes tuned out, in order:
- re-trigger while lying (re-arm gated on having STOOD, not on time),
- rise half-completes → topples → re-limps forever (fixed by riseBoost=4 + riseHold).

**Arms softened** (they bear no load): shoulders/elbows 1.0 → **0.65** strength,
wrists → **0.5**, damping 1.0 unchanged. Stand unaffected (max |v| 6.3 incl. arm swing).

**Stop-whip:** `GroundController.AccelerationTime` 0 → **0.2** (set in setupBody).
The instant capsule brake was whipping the 18.5-mass body forward-then-back on every
stop. Feel verdict pending user playtest.

**Verdict:** kept — user feel-checked all three ("looks good to go", 2026-07-14)
**Observing-client check:** NOT RUN — still the open Gate 1 item

---

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 1 — ✅ GATE 1 PASSED (2-client netsim run)

**Conditions:** Test → Clients and Servers → 2 Players, netsim 150 ms + jitter +
2 % packet loss, SA Visualizer on.
**Result:** user-verified — the observing client reads stand / collapse / rise /
shove response cleanly. Nothing buggy or broken reported.
**Carried (not silently dropped):** the numeric recv KB/s was not noted during the
run, and the `list_roblox_studios` multi-instance question went unchecked. Both roll
into the Gate 2 netsim run, which uses identical conditions.
**Verdict:** GATE 1 CLOSED. The Phase 1 configuration (joint table + densities +
reflexes above) is the frozen baseline. Phase 2 begins.
**Observing-client check:** PASS

---

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 2 (session 1) — sprint, wall crash, balance knob

### What shipped
- **Sprint** (`Shared/Locomotion.luau`): LeftShift → walk 16 → **25.5 measured**.
  Mechanism: the AvatarAbilities **Running ability's `SpeedMultiplier` attribute**
  (Configuration under `character.AbilityManagerActor.Abilities.Running`), which
  the ability applies via `GroundController.MoveSpeedFactor`. Never touch
  WalkSpeed/BaseMoveSpeed. SPRINT_MULT = 1.6.
- **Sprint intent path**: client reads `UserInputService:IsKeyDown` (plain,
  local), fires the MuscleDebug remote on change; **the server is the ONLY
  writer of SpeedMultiplier**, inside the sim.
- **Wall-crash knockdown**: `noteImpact` gained a **wall channel** — horizontal
  capsule decel (>400 stud/s², measured ~1250 on a sprint-wall hit vs ~130 for a
  smoothed stop) with severity from pre-impact speed (WALL = accelMin 400,
  speedMin 18, speedFallAt 26). A dip below **knockdownFactor 0.3** makes
  MuscleServer trigger the fall reflex: tone crash → limp → one boosted rise.
  Verified in server telemetry: hit at 25.6 → MT 1→0.08 → bal 0 → down 1.6 s →
  Rising → stand. Walk-into-wall (16) triggers nothing.
- **FALL.tone 0.15 → 0.08** — must sit BELOW COLLAPSE_BALANCE_THRESHOLD (0.1) or
  an upright knockdown leaves him slumped-but-standing at bal 120 (verified).
- **Body-rel reflex self-motion gates**: a 180° turn swings the body up to
  **~53 stud/s relative** (more than any crate hit) and the swing peaks AFTER
  the turn ends. Gates: turnCooldown 0.4 s after |ωy| ≥ 3, hAccel < 250,
  |speed − 0.5 s-EMA| < 10. Without these the launch dip's rearm swallowed the
  real wall impact.
- **DecelerationTime 0 → 0.2** (matches AccelerationTime; new since the user's
  last feel pass) — removes residual stop-whip AND keeps normal stops out of
  the wall channel.
- **BT attribute** (default 800, remote-validated, panel slider): impulse-250
  ladder → min up **0.91 @ BT 800, 0.82 @ BT 250, 0.81 @ BT 100** — measurably
  deeper stagger, saturating below ~250 because the Root socket decouples body
  hits from the capsule (Phase 1 discovery). The DESIGNED fall boundary lives in
  the impact reflex + knockdownFactor, not raw BT.
- **setupBody race fix**: the ControllerManager can arrive AFTER the joints —
  a session latched setupDone with AccelerationTime still 0. setupBody now
  returns false until the GroundController is configured.
- **VOID_Y = −50 reset** in MuscleServer (a runaway walked off the world and
  fell forever at y = −500).
- Locomotion clips: **stock Animate module** (RunAnimate.Server/.Client pair,
  SA-aware) already blends walk/run into Transform. Animation Graph beta not
  needed for Gate 2.

### ☠️ ENGINE FACTS learned (Server Authority, verified live)
1. **Custom InputAction state does NOT sync client→server** — not even read
   inside the server's BindToSimulation. Only the engine's own input pipeline
   rides the sim timeline. Custom binary intent goes over a validated remote.
2. **Custom InputAction/InputContext instances near the stock input tree can
   WEDGE the engine's input sync for the whole session** — server receives
   MovingDirection (0,0,0) forever while the client walks in place (rubber-band
   pin). Also: a foreign action inside the stock CharacterContext makes the
   AvatarAbilities mapper spam "Unknown action" every frame. **Do not create
   IAS instances** until Roblox documents support. Keybinds via
   UserInputService.
3. **Writing the Running SpeedMultiplier from BOTH peers compounds it**
   (16 → 41 stud/s measured): under SA the writes land as separate
   attribute-change events and the ability multiplies on each. One writer only.
4. Ability system: stock abilities are Configurations (Climbing, Running,
   Jumping, …) under `AbilityManagerActor.Abilities`; `Running.SpeedMultiplier`
   + `SyncedState` child; AbilityAction1–10 exist pre-bound in the runtime
   PlayerModule's `Player.InputContexts.CharacterContext`.

### ☠️ MCP LIVE-TESTING LAWS (cost most of this session — respect them)
- **`character_navigation` does not work under CCL** (rides Humanoid:MoveTo,
  which CCL dropped). Returns "Success", moves nothing.
- **Scripted `MoveAction:Fire()` is unreliable**: the first fire in a session
  may reach the server; later fires (including zeroing!) may not — one runaway
  walked off the world. Do not drive the character with Fire().
- **Real key injection (`user_keyboard_input`) works — ONE burst per play
  session.** Later bursts silently die (input channel/viewport focus). Compose
  everything (flush keyUps first! stuck keys leak across sessions) into a
  single call's action list. Never run an execute in parallel with keyboard
  input (focus flip kills it).
- **Telemetry pattern**: arm a background `task.spawn` sampler (writes to a
  StringValue) BEFORE the keyboard burst; read it after. `execute_luau` can
  RETURN values directly — use that instead of print/console (console output
  is shared, spammy, and truncates).
- **File sync PAUSES while Studio is in Play mode** — `script_grep` verifies
  only in Edit mode. Stop play before editing + verifying. (A stale-file
  session this way produced the 41-stud/s ghost.)

### Open / deferred
- Wall crash: capsule stays planted against the wall during the limp (hover +
  wall prop it up; balance 0 alone cannot tip a static upright capsule —
  verified at bal 0 for 0.9 s). The body goes limp and reads as a crash; the
  full slide-down-the-wall release is **Phase 3's DOWN state** (controller
  release), not Phase 2 tuning.
- Stairs + all feel checks: user playtest (self-serve keyboard choreography is
  too fragile to be worth more MCP cycles).

**Verdict:** kept — pending user feel pass + Gate 2 netsim run
**Observing-client check:** NOT RUN — the Gate 2 items

---

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 2 (session 2) — real falls: the capsule goes down too

**User feedback driving this session:** knockdown reaction delayed; "ragdolled but
still standing" — limbs limp while the hips stay pinned upright and WALKABLE.
Both confirmed and fixed; two knockdown cycles verified end-to-end (heap at
hrpY 0.4 → stable stand ≈3.5 s later, repeatable).

**The fixes, in dependency order:**
1. **Asymmetric master-tone slew**: DOWN is instant (muscles switching off can't
   slingshot — the 0.6 s up-slew was the perceived knockdown lag), UP stays
   slewed. While `Rising`, the up-ramp runs at **riseRamp 4**/s (6 made the legs
   snap to power while the feet caught ground → an 8-stud hop, verified).
2. **Capsule release** (`MuscleSystem.setCapsuleReleased`): while `fallTimer` is
   live, `GroundController.StandForce = 0` and `BaseMoveSpeed = 0` — the hips
   fall WITH the body (hrpY 4.8 → 1.4 verified) and walking-while-ragdolled is
   impossible. Restored at the rise.
3. **Get-up assist** (`MuscleSystem.getUpAssist`): a capsule that fell with the
   body lies flat, its floor sensor points sideways, and the GroundController
   can NEVER right it (verified: stuck lying forever). Until Phase 3's physical
   get-up: one server-side pivot — velocities zeroed, yaw kept, pelvis lifted
   +3.0 (at +2.5 sprawled limbs snag the ground and flop the capsule back).
4. **Rise watchdog** (riseTimeout 2.0, retryDown 0.8): a failed rise retries the
   whole down-and-right cycle. MUST check posture at expiry — a blind retry
   knocked down successful stands (verified).
5. **riseGrace 1.0 + riseHold 1.5**: the impact reflex is fully deaf while
   Rising and for 1 s after — get-up motion exceeds every impact threshold and
   re-felled the body in a loop (verified); and 0.5 s of upright re-armed the
   tilt trigger mid-wobble (verified).

**Engine facts (verified live, all dead ends — do not revisit):**
- `Humanoid:ChangeState(Physics)` is a NO-OP under the CCL ability state
  machine — state reverts to Running the same frame.
- Writing ability `SyncedState` attributes (`Active`/`Enabled`) from outside
  the AbilityManagerActor changes the attributes and nothing else.
- `StandForce = 0` alone does nothing at full tone — the LEGS hold the capsule
  through the Root socket; hover only matters once the body is limp.
- A direct `SetAttribute("MT", x)` from an execute is overwritten by the server
  slew loop within a step — force limpness via impulse-triggered reflex or the
  remote, never by poking MT.

**Verdict:** kept — awaiting user feel pass (knockdown → heap → scramble-up;
the get-up is an assisted pivot until Phase 3, expect it to read as functional,
not beautiful)
**Observing-client check:** NOT RUN — Gate 2 items

---

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 2 (session 3) — killing the pinned-marionette states

**User feedback driving this session:** (a) walking/turning feels like ice
skates — "movement through an invisible core, not driven by the legs";
(b) wall knockdowns leave the body "pinned into the wall by the hips";
(c) walking knockdowns sometimes leave limbs limp but hips upright and walkable.

**Diagnosis (server telemetry, 50–120 ms sampling through forced fall cycles):**
1. **The marionette window.** The fall trigger is disarmed while `Rising`, so a
   rise that TOPPLED lay on the ground with the capsule at FULL power —
   StandForce 10000, BaseMoveSpeed 16, walkable — until the watchdog expired.
   Measured: 0.9 s at up=0.00 fully powered. Against a wall this is exactly
   "pinned by the hips". Ability-stomp theory CLEARED: `FallingDown` goes
   Active during our falls but touches none of our properties.
2. **The mid-band dip.** An impact factor between knockdownFactor and 1 zeroed
   `BalanceMaxTorque`-ish on a body that STAYS standing: root orientation goes
   free, limbs flop, capsule keeps height and accepts WASD. A jog-speed wall
   hit (19–24 stud/s, below the sprint knockdown band) lands exactly here.
3. **Turn speed.** Stock `ControllerManager.BaseTurnSpeed = 16` ≈ instant pivot
   about the capsule axis — the "invisible core" turning feel.
   (Also corrected: live `GroundOffset` reads **2.925**, not the 1 recorded
   earlier.)

**Fixes (all verified live this session):**
1. **Rise fast-fail**: while `Rising`, `upY < tiltUp` retries the down-and-right
   cycle IMMEDIATELY instead of waiting out the watchdog. Verified: failed rise
   re-released within one 100 ms sample (was 0.9 s+).
2. **Stagger floor = knockdownFactor, raised 0.3 → 0.45**: `updateBalance`
   clamps the applied dip to ≥ 0.45, so balance never collapses on a standing
   body; a RAW factor below 0.45 is now a real knockdown (fall reflex, capsule
   release). Binary outcome: readable wobble or actually down. Verified:
   moderate hit (rel ≈ 29) → BMT 800→691 wobble, no fall; hard hit → down at
   0.37 s, walkable stand at 4.57 s.
3. **Per-step release enforcement**: `setCapsuleReleased(char, released,
   moveLock)` runs EVERY server step (write-on-change), not at transitions —
   no state path can strand a limp body on a live capsule.
4. **Move lock through the get-up**: `BaseMoveSpeed = 0` while `fallTimer > 0`
   OR `Rising` — walking mid-rise yanked the half-risen body over, and the
   get-up should read as committed. Restores when upright re-arms (~1.5 s
   after standing). Walk verified clean after: max 17.2 stud/s, up 1.00.
5. **TS / AL live knobs** (attrs + panel sliders, clamps 0–40 / 0–4):
   `BaseTurnSpeed` default **8** (stock 16) — the ice-skate lever;
   `AccelerationLean` default 1 (stock). Applied in `updateBalance`
   write-on-change, both peers, deterministic.

**Addendum (same day, user: "still pins briefly when going ragdoll"):**
1. **Dip escalation.** A hit RAMPS across frames: the first threshold crossing
   locked the window at that frame's MILD severity and the true peak (2–3
   frames later) was swallowed by one-dip-per-window — so real knockdowns
   registered as wobbles and the fall waited for the slow tilt trigger. Now a
   deeper factor escalates an ACTIVE window in place (never during the re-arm
   tail — that would re-open the boundary-struggle loop; timer NOT refreshed —
   escalation can't self-chain off the flop). Verified: mild hit (rel 32) +
   deep hit 0.15 s later inside the window → knockdown 80 ms after the peak
   (previously swallowed entirely, no fall).
2. **tiltUp 0.55 → 0.65.** At 0.55 the tilt trigger waited until ~56° — the
   body read as fully going over while the capsule stayed pinned. Successful
   rises hold upY ≥ 0.94, so 0.65 does not false-fail them. Reference tilt
   cycle after both changes: fell 0.35 s, walkable stand 4.75 s, 1 retry —
   recovery unchanged.
3. A brutal double hit (rel 32 then 85+25) needed several retry cycles
   (>8.5 s) but recovered clean — clumsy-but-alive is the accepted Phase 2
   bar; the physical get-up is Phase 3.

**Addendum 2 (same day, user: "still pins", "3rd fix and not fixed — better
debugging?"):**
1. **Client-side verification (new instrument class).** All prior verification
   sampled the SERVER; the user plays the CLIENT. A client-DM sampler during a
   forced fall settled it: controller property replication is FINE — client
   StandForce/BMS/BMT track the server within ≤1 sample (~70 ms at client
   frame rate), pelvis heaps with the capsule (3.8 → 1.6), worst transient
   marionette moment ≤150 ms. Both sims agree; the remaining user-felt pin is
   a real designed state my synthetic repros don't hit.
2. **Prime suspect: the wall stagger band.** 18–22 stud/s wall hits produced a
   deep stagger (no knockdown): body slumps against the wall, hips held at
   stand height by design = reads exactly as "pinned into the wall by the
   hips". WALL now speedMin 17 / speedFallAt 22 → knockdown from ~20 stud/s.
   Walls are binary: walk-bump nothing, brisk jog+ DOWN.
3. **Fall recorder (DebugPanel).** Client-side ring buffer (~7 s at frame
   rate: hrpY, pelvisY, upY, SF, BMS, BMT, MT, Rising, speed) → freezes to the
   client-side `FallCapture` StringValue 3 s after any tone crash, or via the
   panel button "Capture last 7 s" when a moment merely feels wrong. Read it
   with an execute in the **Client** DM. Verified end-to-end (auto-capture of
   a live knockdown). THE tool for feel-report triage — no more guessing.
4. **StandForce slider ("SF" attr, 0–20000)** — the hover-ladder experiment
   lane toward leg-supported locomotion (user direction). setCapsuleReleased
   restores to the attr, not a constant. Standing at SF=0 full tone already
   verified; next: walk/stairs at 5000/2500/0.

**Addendum 3 (same day) — THE FROZEN PIN, root-caused by the recorder:**
The user's first real capture showed the bug in full: body lying flat for
seconds at MT=1.00, capsule "standing" (SF 10000, BMS 16, BMT 800), Rising=0
— the fall machine believed all was well. Console had the missing link: **two
stability-guard resets** during ordinary play (RightFoot w=516, RightHand
w=333 tripped RUNAWAY_ANGULAR 250 during limp flops). The guard reset cleared
the fall state but did NOT re-arm `fallArmed` — a reset that toppled after
re-pinning landed in a state NO code path could ever leave: the frozen pin.
1. **Guard reset now re-arms** (`fallArmed = true`, downHold = 0).
2. **RUNAWAY_ANGULAR 250 → 800**: the guard catches explosions, not lively
   ragdolls — 333/516 rad/s occur in ordinary user flops (measured).
3. **Stranded catch-all (`FALL.strandedDown = 0.75`)**: ANY body down that
   long at power triggers the full fall cycle regardless of arming. No
   reachable state may lie powered on the ground — the class is self-healing
   now, not just the known doors.
4. **knockedDown no longer requires `fallArmed`** — the reflex is
   upright-gated + rise-deaf so it can't loop on a lying body; wall hits
   during the post-recovery window were being silently ignored
   (user: "running into the wall no longer ragdolls" — partially this).
5. **FS attribute** ("up"/"down"/"rising", server-mirrored on change) +
   recorder columns Pwr/FS — server state machine is now visible in every
   client capture.
6. Insight from the failed disarm-window repro: `Rising` clears at the exact
   step `fallArmed` re-arms (atomic) — so the rise fast-fail already covers
   every topple between stand and re-arm (verified: 0.00 s release). The
   guard reset was the ONLY door into disarmed+lying; it is closed and
   backstopped.
Verified: forced explosion-reset mid-fall → back standing armed (up 1.00,
FS=up), next tilt releases in 0.03 s (old code: never — the eternal pin).

**Addendum 4 (same day) — THE MID-AIR PIN: the HRP is a collidable box.**
User capture (prop collision, with Pwr/FS columns): knockdown fired INSTANTLY
and correctly (FS=down, SF=0, MT=0.08 at the hit) — yet the body hung 1.3 s
at standing height, near-upright, fully released. Nothing in the force system
held it. What held it: **the HumanoidRootPart is an invisible 2×2×1
COLLIDABLE box with the pelvis ball-socketed to it** — the box landed on top
of the prop and the limp body dangled from it. Same mechanism as the earlier
"pinned INTO the wall by the hips" (box leans on wall). The force-side
releases were never enough; the pin was collision GEOMETRY, not forces.
- Fix: while released, `HumanoidRootPart.CanCollide = false` (per-step
  enforced in setCapsuleReleased). The 18.5-mass body drags the 2.0-mass
  ghost box wherever it heaps; nothing can snag. Restored with the rise
  (getUpAssist pivots +3 first, same step, so it re-collides above ground).
- Verified on a reproduced prop knockdown (dropped tilted onto a 4-stud
  crate): dangling signature 1.3 s → **0.28 s** (residue = the body itself
  sliding off the crate), and it recovered to a legitimate stand ON the
  crate. The DOWN state is now a true free ragdoll — an architecture-
  independent property any future locomotion system also needs.

**Addendum 5 (same day) — THE 0.5 s ONSET PIN: the capsule never tips.**
User: "still pins ~0.5 s then falls like normal ragdoll." Instrumented
discovery that rewrites the fall model: **under balance the capsule is
orientation-LOCKED** — a driven 2 rad/s spin sustained for 1.5 s left
up=1.00 (the balance servo cancels rotation within each step; it is a
gyroscope, not a spring). Consequences:
- The tilt trigger (upY < 0.65) can barely ever fire in a real trip — the
  capsule does not tip; the BODY folds over the obstacle while the hips
  hang from the locked capsule. The ~0.5 s pin was the body-rel reflex
  slowly noticing what the tilt path never would.
- **Torso-divergence trigger** (the trip detector): armed AND
  `UpperTorso.UpVector.Y < torsoDiverge (0.55)` sustained `torsoTime
  (0.15 s)` → fall. The body's pose is the truth; the capsule's tilt is
  propaganda. Walk/sprint torso pitch stays > ~0.9; stop-whips are shorter
  than torsoTime.
- Also added committed-topple trigger (tipUp 0.9 + tipRate 1.5 rad/s
  horizontal) for capsules that physically lose the lock (sensor lost) —
  verified it cannot false-fire from nudges (w=1.0 → recovered, no fall).
- Verified trip emulation (sustained 30 stud/s forward fold on torso+head):
  fold start → release **0.135 s** (was ~0.5 s+ user-felt); capsule up was
  still 0.75 at release — the old path would still have been waiting.
  Clean recovery to stand afterwards (FS=up, MT 1.0).

**Verdict:** kept — awaiting user feel pass (turn feel is user-tunable now via
the TurnSpeed slider; report the value that feels right)
**Observing-client check:** NOT RUN — Gate 2 items
